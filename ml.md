## Motivation

* AI goal: replace human programming with "self-programming"
  (= predict appropriate behavior based on experience)

* The example: infants

    * language skills
    * motor skills
    * other behaviors

* Usual dichotomy:

    * Algorithmic/heuristic "tricks"

    * Simulate human behavior (infant brain)

## ML and Systems

* Data flow in ML systems

    * Supervised: Train first, then use

    * Reinforcement: Train during use

* Data complexity

    * Boolean, discrete, continuous

    * This course mostly Boolean

* ML system evaluation

    * statistical significance

    * negative and positive examples

    * Type I (false-positive) and Type II (false-negative) error

    * Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves

## Modes Of Learning

* "Discovery" learning and "generalization" learning

    * TD-Gammon

    * Relation between discovery learning and generalization
      learning

* Deductive learning: concluding things from principles

    * Theorem proving

    * Knowledge compilation

    * Deductive "KR-based" learning in some database

    * Basic idea: cache most general easily-derivable
      version of result in case similar query later

## Inductive learning

* Supervised vs. reinforcement

* Training, validation (test), and classification data

* Overtraining and overfitting

* Ensemble learning: e.g. boosting
